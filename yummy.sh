When you think about automating infrastructure, two tools often come to mind: Terraform and Ansible. They’re both powerful, but they serve different purposes. And while they’re often compared, the real question isn’t which one to use — it’s how to use them together.

Let’s start with Terraform. Terraform is declarative
. You tell it what you want, 
and it figures out how to get there
. For example, if you want a database, 
a Kubernetes cluster, and some virtual machines
 in a virtual private cloud (VPC), you
  describe these resources in a configuration file. Terraform then creates them in the right order, even if there are dependencies between them. If the database depends on the Kubernetes cluster, Terraform will create the cluster first. This is called an implicit dependency. You can also define explicit dependencies, but Terraform’s declarative nature often handles this for you.
